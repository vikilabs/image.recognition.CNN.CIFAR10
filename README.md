![alt text](demo.gif)

Additional Infos:

    1. Under the hood image recognization happens with Convolutional Neural Network with 
       ADAM Optimizer.
    2. This software uses CIFAR 10 image database for training CNN
    3. Uses PyTkinter for User Interface
    4. Neural Network is implemented using PyTorch
